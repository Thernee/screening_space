What's a developer witthout a To_Do List app right?
I thought too build this simple App based on the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) Principles. which are used in almost all mordern web Applications.
The App uses basic javascript to dynamically update users input into an Unordered list.
Users can create tasks, mark tasks as one, or delete Tasks.
